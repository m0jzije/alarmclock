# Simple Alarm Clock

This is a simple alarm clock application created as a project for CS305 at the International University of Sarajevo. The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in C#, Python, and JavaScript by implementing the same functionality in each of these programming languages. Additionally, the project features a display imitation for the alarm clock interface.

The project was completed by a team of three students:
- Munever Hasanovic
- Harun Subasic
- Amra Hozic

## Features

The alarm clock application allows the user to set a desired alarm time and provides an audible alert when the alarm time is reached. The application is implemented in three separate versions, one for each of the following programming languages:

1. C#
2. Python
3. JavaScript

All three versions of the alarm clock application include a display imitation to mimic the look and feel of a traditional alarm clock display.

## Installation and Usage

### C# Version

The C# version of the alarm clock is a **console-based application** built using the .NET framework. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for setting an alarm, displaying the current time, and handling snooze or turn-off functionality.

### Key Features of the C# Version:
- **Set Alarm**: Users can input a future time in `HH:mm` format to set an alarm.
- **Real-Time Clock Display**: The current time is displayed in a **7-segment display imitation** using ASCII art, updating every second.
- **Alarm Notification**: When the alarm time is reached, the application plays a **beep sound** and displays a notification.
- **Snooze Functionality**: Users can snooze the alarm for a predefined duration (default: 1 minute).
- **Turn Off Alarm**: Users can turn off the alarm completely.
- **Dynamic Time Display**: The time display is dynamically centered within an ASCII art box, ensuring a clean and visually appealing interface.
