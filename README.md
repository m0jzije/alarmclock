# Simple Alarm Clock

This is a simple alarm clock application created as a project for CS305 at the International University of Sarajevo. The aim of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in C#, Python, and JavaScript by implementing the same functionality in each of these programming languages. Additionally, the project features a 7-segment display imitation for the alarm clock interface.

The project was completed by a team of three students:
- Munever Hasanovic
- Harun Subasic
- Amra Hozic

## Features

The alarm clock application allows the user to set a desired alarm time and provides an audible alert when the alarm time is reached. The application is implemented in three separate versions, one for each of the following programming languages:

1. C#
2. Python
3. JavaScript

All three versions of the alarm clock application include a 7-segment display imitation to mimic the look and feel of a traditional alarm clock display.

## Installation and Usage

Please refer to the individual language-specific README files for instructions on how to install and use the alarm clock application:

- [C# Version](c-sharp/README.md)
- [Python Version](python/README.md)
- [JavaScript Version](javascript/README.md)
